# Contents
Courseworks and projects about functional programming and monads using Haskell. In functional programming, functions are treated as data, and state mutation is discouraged or forbidden completely. See below for detail explanation.

* Haskell basics, laziness, evaluation rule. See `./basics`.

* Algebraic datatypes (declaration and implementation). A red-black integer tree is implemented in `./algebraic_datatypes`.

* Type classes, operators and fixities. A matrix class taking advantage of its sparsity (i.e., sparse matrix) is implemented in `./class_implementations`. 

* IO monads, standalone programs workflow. A Sudoku solver is implemented in `./IO_monad`.

* List monads, monad laws, and conceptual derivation. See `./monad_and_laws`.

* State monads and general exploration. Finally, a Scheme and XML parser is implemented in `parser_design`.
